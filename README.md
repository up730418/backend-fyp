# Final year project backend

A Node and MongoDB backend for my final year project

## How to setup (simple)

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running then:

`git clone https://github.com/up730418/backend-fyp`

`npm install`

`npm start`

visit the localhost:8080 and the app will be running


## Develping
If you only wish to develop on the backend api then this is all you need simply clone this repo and  develp away!


If you wish to develop the front and backend you will also need to clone the https://github.com/up730418/angular-fyp repository adn follow the instructions here for developing.


Note: If developing the angular part of this project you will need to have both the angular server running and this server to handle the api calls. This can be done by running `ng serve` in the angualr folder and in a seperate command window running `npm start`. Any backend changes will requre a restart to become visible wheras angular changes will automatically force a rebuild.
